## 🔍 Port Scanning Results

**Target:** 192.168.1.1 (Zyxel Router)

### Open Ports Detected: 7

| Port | Protocol | State | Service | Version |
|------|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| 22 | TCP | Filtered | SSH | - |
| 23 | TCP | Filtered | Telnet | - |
| 53 | TCP | Open | DNS | dnsmasq 2.84rc2 |
| 80 | TCP | Open | HTTP | mini_httpd 1.30 26Oct2018 |

## 🔒 Vulnerability Scanning Results

**Target:** 192.168.1.1 (Zyxel Router)

### Vulnerability Assessment:
- **Total Vulnerabilities:** 0 (with CVSS ≥ 5.0)
- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 0
- **Low:** 0

### Analysis:
The router appears to have no detected vulnerabilities with CVSS score ≥ 5.0. This could indicate:
1. The device is well-patched and up-to-date
2. The services running are not in the vulnerability databases
3. Additional NSE scripts may be needed for deeper analysis

**Note:** Vulnerability scanning depends on:
- nmap NSE scripts (vulners, vulscan, vuln)
- CVE databases being up-to-date
- Service version detection accuracy

5. **Clean JSON output** - Easy to parse and integrate

### Areas for Enhancement:
1. **Unknown devices** - 5 devices couldn't be identified (random MAC addresses)
2. **Vulnerability database** - May need additional CVE sources
3. **Scan speed** - Full port scan takes 5-10 minutes (trade-off for accuracy)
4. **Documentation** - Consider adding device fingerprinting for unknown devices

### Security Recommendations:
1. ✅ Disable Telnet completely (currently filtered)
2. ✅ Keep SSH filtered unless needed
3. ℹ️ Consider securing MQTT port 8883 with firewall rules
4. ℹ️ Regular vulnerability scans recommended (weekly/monthly)
